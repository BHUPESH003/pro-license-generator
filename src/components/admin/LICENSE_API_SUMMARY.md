### üìÅ Files Created:

#### API Endpoints:

- `src/app/api/admin/licenses/route.ts` - Main license listing and CSV export
- `src/app/api/admin/licenses/[id]/route.ts` - License detail with activity timeline
- `src/app/api/admin/licenses/[id]/actions/route.ts` - License actions (activate/deactivate/update)
- `src/app/api/admin/licenses/stats/route.ts` - License statistics and filter options

### üîß Technical Implementation Details:

#### Main License Listing (`/api/admin/licenses`)

**Features:**

- Server-side pagination with configurable page sizes
- Multi-field sorting with MongoDB indexes
- Advanced filtering with query parameter mapping
- User and device data aggregation in single query
- CSV export with same filtering capabilities

**Supported Filters:**

- `filter_status` - License status (active/inactive)
