### üìÅ Files Created:

#### API Endpoints:

- `src/app/api/admin/devices/route.ts` - Main device listing and CSV export
- `src/app/api/admin/devices/[id]/route.ts` - Device detail with telemetry and activity
- `src/app/api/admin/devices/[id]/actions/route.ts` - Device actions (rename/activate/deactivate/unbind)
- `src/app/api/admin/devices/stats/route.ts` - Device statistics and filter options

### üîß Technical Implementation Details:

#### Main Device Listing (`/api/admin/devices`)

**Features:**

- Server-side pagination with configurable page sizes
- Multi-field sorting with MongoDB indexes
- Advanced filtering with cross-collection queries
- Telemetry statistics aggregation for each device
- CSV export with comprehensive device information

**Supported Filters:**

- `filter_status` - Device status (active/inactive)
- `filter_os` - Operating system (regex search)
- `filter_deviceGuid` - Device GUID search (regex)
- `filter_name` - Device name search (regex)
- `filter_userEmail` - Associated user email search
- `filter_licenseKey` - Associated license key search
- `filter_lastActivityAfter/Before` - Activity date range

**Aggregation Pipeline:**

```javascript
[
  { $match: filterQuery },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "users",
      localField: "userId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "user",
      pipeline: [{ $project: { email: 1, name: 1 } }],
    },
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "licenses",
      localField: "licenseId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "license",
      pipeline: [{ $project: { licenseKey: 1, status: 1, plan: 1 } }],
    },
  },
  {
    $addFields: {
      user: { $arrayElemAt: ["$user", 0] },
      license: { $arrayElemAt: ["$license", 0] },
    },
  },
];
```
