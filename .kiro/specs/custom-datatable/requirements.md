# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a custom, reusable DataTable component to replace the current ag-grid implementation that has been causing multiple bugs including infinite API calls, filter state issues, and double API calls. The new component will be built from scratch to provide a robust, performant, and maintainable solution for displaying tabular data across the admin panel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to view data in a paginated table format, so that I can efficiently browse through large datasets without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the table loads THEN the system SHALL display data with server-side pagination
2. WHEN I select a page size THEN the system SHALL support configurable page sizes (10, 25, 50, 100)
3. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain current filters and sorting
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the current page number and total pages
5. IF there are no results THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to sort data by multiple columns, so that I can organize information according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a column header THEN the system SHALL sort data by that column in ascending order
2. WHEN I click the same column header again THEN the system SHALL sort data in descending order
3. WHEN I click a third time THEN the system SHALL remove sorting for that column
4. WHEN sorting is applied THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators (arrows) showing sort direction
5. WHEN I sort by multiple columns THEN the system SHALL maintain the sort hierarchy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to filter data using various filter types, so that I can quickly find specific information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in a text filter THEN the system SHALL debounce the input by 300ms before making API calls
2. WHEN I select from a dropdown filter THEN the system SHALL apply the filter immediately
3. WHEN I select a date range THEN the system SHALL apply the filter immediately
4. WHEN I change any filter THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately for visual feedback
5. WHEN I click "Clear All Filters" THEN the system SHALL reset all filters to their default state
6. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain filter state in the URL for page refresh persistence

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to search across all table columns, so that I can quickly locate specific data without knowing which column contains the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter text in the global search THEN the system SHALL search across all visible columns
2. WHEN I type in the search box THEN the system SHALL debounce the input by 300ms
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text in the results
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no results" message
5. WHEN I clear the search THEN the system SHALL return to the unfiltered dataset

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to select table rows, so that I can perform bulk actions on multiple items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a row checkbox THEN the system SHALL select that individual row
2. WHEN I click the header checkbox THEN the system SHALL select all visible rows on the current page
3. WHEN rows are selected THEN the system SHALL display the selection count
4. WHEN I navigate to a different page THEN the system SHALL maintain selections from previous pages
5. WHEN I perform a bulk action THEN the system SHALL apply the action to all selected rows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to export table data to CSV, so that I can analyze data in external tools or create reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the export button THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with current data
2. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL export only the filtered data
3. WHEN the export is processing THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
4. WHEN the export completes THEN the system SHALL automatically download the CSV file
5. IF the export fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry option

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the table to handle loading and error states gracefully, so that I have clear feedback about the system status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display skeleton loading animations
2. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry option
3. WHEN retrying a failed request THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
4. WHEN the table is empty THEN the system SHALL display a customizable empty state message
5. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate offline message

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the table to be responsive across different devices, so that I can access admin functions on mobile and tablet devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for smaller screens
2. WHEN columns don't fit THEN the system SHALL provide horizontal scrolling
3. WHEN on touch devices THEN the system SHALL support touch gestures for navigation
4. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout dynamically
5. WHEN on small screens THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most important columns

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable component with TypeScript support, so that I can easily integrate it across different admin pages with type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the component THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript generics for any data type
2. WHEN configuring the component THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive prop interfaces
3. WHEN using the component THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API as the current DataTable
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL be wrapped in error boundaries
5. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide debug logging capabilities

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component to integrate seamlessly with existing systems, so that migration from ag-grid requires minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing ag-grid THEN the system SHALL maintain the same prop interface
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use the existing API response format
3. WHEN styling the component THEN the system SHALL use existing UI components and theme
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing admin protection
5. WHEN displaying notifications THEN the system SHALL use the existing notification system

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the table to be fully accessible, so that I can navigate and interact with the data using assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and roles
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation
3. WHEN focus changes THEN the system SHALL manage focus appropriately
4. WHEN in high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL maintain readability
5. WHEN using voice control THEN the system SHALL support voice navigation commands

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the component to perform efficiently, so that it doesn't impact application performance or cause memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering large datasets THEN the system SHALL NOT cause infinite loops or unnecessary re-renders
2. WHEN filtering text inputs THEN the system SHALL debounce API calls to prevent spam
3. WHEN components update THEN the system SHALL use memoization for optimal performance
4. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL clean up all subscriptions and timers
5. WHEN state changes occur THEN the system SHALL avoid circular dependencies that cause re-render cycles
