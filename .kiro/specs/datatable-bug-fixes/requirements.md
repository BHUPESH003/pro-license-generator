# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MyCleanOne Admin Panel uses a custom DataTable component built with AG Grid for displaying and managing data across multiple admin interfaces. Currently, there are several critical bugs affecting the user experience and functionality that need to be addressed to ensure proper operation of the admin panel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want the DataTable to properly support dark theme, so that the table appearance is consistent with the admin panel's theme settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin panel is in dark mode THEN the DataTable SHALL render with dark theme styling
2. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN the DataTable SHALL update its appearance accordingly
3. WHEN filters are applied in dark mode THEN both the filter controls and table content SHALL use dark theme styling
4. WHEN the table is loading or empty in dark mode THEN loading states and empty states SHALL use appropriate dark theme colors
5. WHEN hovering over rows or cells in dark mode THEN hover effects SHALL use dark theme appropriate colors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want action buttons in table rows to not trigger row click events, so that I can perform actions without unintentionally opening detail drawers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on action buttons in table rows THEN the system SHALL prevent row click events from firing
2. WHEN clicking on action buttons THEN only the specific action SHALL be executed
3. WHEN clicking on other parts of the row THEN the row click event SHALL fire normally to open detail drawers
4. WHEN action buttons are disabled THEN clicking them SHALL not trigger any events
5. WHEN multiple action buttons exist in a row THEN each button SHALL independently prevent row click propagation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want table filters to work correctly with server-side operations, so that I can efficiently filter large datasets without stale data issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL immediately make API calls with the latest filter values
2. WHEN filter values change THEN the system SHALL ensure the API request includes the updated filters before making the call
3. WHEN multiple filters are applied quickly THEN the system SHALL debounce requests and use the latest filter state
4. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL immediately fetch unfiltered data
5. WHEN navigating between pages with filters applied THEN the system SHALL maintain filter state and make requests with current filters
6. WHEN the page is refreshed with filters in URL THEN the system SHALL restore filter state and make API calls with correct parameters
7. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include current filter state in the export request

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want all existing DataTable functionality to remain intact, so that pagination, sorting, CSV export, and other features continue to work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using pagination controls THEN the system SHALL maintain current filters and sorting while changing pages
2. WHEN sorting columns THEN the system SHALL maintain current filters and reset to first page
3. WHEN exporting to CSV THEN the system SHALL include filtered and sorted data according to current table state
4. WHEN URL parameters change THEN the system SHALL sync table state correctly with browser navigation
5. WHEN multiple DataTable instances exist on different pages THEN each SHALL maintain independent state management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want the DataTable fixes to be applied consistently across all admin interfaces, so that all admin pages have the same improved functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the DataTable component is updated THEN all admin pages using DataTable SHALL benefit from the fixes
2. WHEN testing the fixes THEN licenses, devices, users, telemetry, and audit pages SHALL all work correctly
3. WHEN verifying functionality THEN each admin page SHALL maintain its specific column configurations and actions
4. WHEN checking theme consistency THEN all DataTable instances SHALL properly support dark/light theme switching
5. WHEN validating filter behavior THEN all DataTable instances SHALL have working server-side filtering without stale data issues
